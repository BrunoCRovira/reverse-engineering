* determine exactly what a particular suspect binary can do.
* how to detect it in your network
* how to measure and contain its damage.
* develope signatures to detect malware infections.
  * **Host-based-signatures**:used to detect malicious code on victim computers.
  * **Network Signatures**: used to detect malicious code by monitoring network traffic.
* Figure out exactly how the malware works.

###  Malware analysis Techniques.

* **Basic Static Analysis** 
  > Consists of examining the executable file without viewing the actual instructions.
* **Basic Dynamic Analisys**
  > Involve running malware observing its behavior on the system.
* **Advanced Static Analysis**
  > consists of reverse-engineering the malware's internals by loading the execuatable into a disassembler.
* **Advanced Dynamic Analysis**
  > Uses a devugger to examine the internal state of a running malicious executable.
